{"0":{"Q":"What is CNV?","A":"CNV is Copy Number Variances. It is when a stretch of DNA that is 1kb or larger that has a different number of copies when compared to the reference genome.","score":0},"1":{"Q":"what is triplet repeat disorder?","A":"increase in nucleotide triplet repeats (e.g CAGCAGCAG….CAG) within a certain gene. Threshold of occurrence – if triplet repeat occurs above a certain frequency, then more likely to cause disease.","score":0},"2":{"Q":"What is epistasis?","A":"Phenomenon where gene interactions (i.e. proteins interactions) lead to detectable phenotypic changes.","score":0},"3":{"Q":"What is structural variants?","A":"variation in chromosome structure approximately 1kb or larger, such as inversions, translocation (switching of chromosomal region)","score":0},"4":{"Q":"What is CD4?","A":"co-receptor that assists the T cell receptor in communicating with APCs (antigen-presenting cells).","score":0},"5":{"Q":"What is immunogenicity?","A":"the likelihood of generating an immune response. High immunogenicity means high likelihood of immune response\nLow immunogenicity means a low likelihood of immune response.\n","score":0},"6":{"Q":"How are neoantigens detected?","A":"Find proteins that are present in tumors that are not present in normal cells. Amino acid changes in these proteins can be caused by mutations, splicing, and indels.","score":0},"7":{"Q":"What are antigen-presenting cells?","A":"Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are a heterogeneous group of immune cells that mediate the cellular immune response by processing and presenting antigens for recognition by certain lymphocytes such as T cells.","score":0},"8":{"Q":"What are neoORFs?","A":"NeoORF is long, completely novel stretches of amino acids. Usually generated by out-of-frame insertions or deletions in gene. .","score":0},"9":{"Q":"How are neoantigens found?","A":"1 - Looking for nonsynonymous mutations in tumor tissue. 2 - using algorithms to identify peptides with the potential to bind to HLA proteins.","score":0},"10":{"Q":"What are the 3 phases of immunoediting?","A":"They are elimination, equilibrium, and escape.","score":0},"11":{"Q":"What is immunosurveillance?","A":"Immunosurveillance is the process of finding transformed cells (cancer cells) in order to inhibit growth of neoplastic tissue. This is the first step of immunoediting.","score":0},"12":{"Q":"What is immune tolerance?","A":"State of the immune system where it does not respond to antigens that would usually elicit an immune response","score":0},"13":{"Q":"What are some errors in RNA-seq?","A":"1 - biases in amplifying transcripts based on G-C content, priming with random hexamers, cDNA synthesis, ligation. 2 - transcript-length bias as longer transcripts generate more fragments. 3 - mapping error caused by multimapping, repetitive sequences, sequencing errors. 4 - polyA mRNA enrichment - may enrich for RNA degradation products","score":0},"14":{"Q":"What is a Pribnow box?","A":"The starting point for transcription in prokaryotes. It is around 10 bp upstream of transcription start site. Prokaryotes have Pribnow box, Eukaryotes and Archaea have TATA box.","score":0},"15":{"Q":"what are professional APCs?","A":"?","score":0},"16":{"Q":"what are non-professional APCs?","A":"? look at wikipedia","score":0}}
